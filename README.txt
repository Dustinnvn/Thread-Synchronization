Description
-----------

This assignment demonstrates designing and writing a real 
     scenario/application with multithreaded synchronization, 
     implemented in Linux using POSIX Threads (Pthreads).

---------------------
Running the C Program
---------------------

1) Download the C program file: Project2.c

2) Download the makefile and run files

3) Ensure that the downloaded files are all in the same directory

4) Open the terminal

5) In the command line, enter "make"

     This will allow the terminal to run the Makefile, thus compiling the code for the C program file

6) To run the C program, enter the following command line in the terminal:

     ./run <Number1> <Number2>

	- Number1: the number of students
	- Number2: the room capacity
		
	(Note: Number1 and Number2 both must be non-negative and non-zero integers)
